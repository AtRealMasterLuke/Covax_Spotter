#### Libraries used
[Navigation Components](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started)  
##### [Fragments](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/kotlin-android-training-create-and-add-fragment)
These are the screens to be displayed and they will be hosted by the main activity.
A Fragment represents a behavior or a portion of user interface (UI) in an Activity. You can combine multiple fragments in a single activity to build a multi-pane UI, and you can reuse a Fragment in multiple activities.

Think of a Fragment as a modular section of an activity, something like a "sub-activity" that you can also use in other activities:

A Fragment has its own lifecycle and receives its own input events.
You can add or remove a Fragment while the activity is running.
A Fragment is defined in a Kotlin class.
A Fragment's UI is defined in an XML layout file.
